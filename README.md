# Club Manager — Hackathon Submission (Simple)

A minimal, easy-to-run full-stack project for the hackathon:

- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite3 (file-based, `clubs.db` created automatically)

## Features
- List clubs
- Add a club (name, contact, meetings, description)
- Delete a club
- Small seed data included

## How to run (VS Code / Terminal)
1. Make sure you have **Node.js (v14+)** installed.
2. Open terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

That's it — no Git required. The SQLite file `clubs.db` will be created in the project root.
